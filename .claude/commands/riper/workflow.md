# Full RIPER Workflow

I'll guide you through the complete RIPER workflow for: $ARGUMENTS

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: RESEARCH
First, I'll use the research-innovate agent in RESEARCH sub-mode to understand the current state of the codebase and gather all necessary information.

### Phase 2: INNOVATE  
Next, I'll use the research-innovate agent in INNOVATE sub-mode to brainstorm different approaches and explore possibilities.

### Phase 3: PLAN
Then, I'll use the plan-execute agent in PLAN sub-mode to create detailed technical specifications that you can review.

**⚠️ APPROVAL GATE**: I will pause here for your explicit approval before proceeding.

### Phase 4: EXECUTE
Once approved, I'll use the plan-execute agent in EXECUTE sub-mode to implement exactly what was planned.

### Phase 5: REVIEW
Finally, I'll use the review agent to validate the implementation against the plan.
