1
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,416
Well, Little Kitty,

2
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:17,582
if you really want to learn how to catch flies,

3
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:20,917
you've got to study the masters

4
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:24,417
like the Venus Flytrap!

5
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,542
Wait, plants can catch flies?

6
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:30,250
Oh yes!

7
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:30,792
So, let me answer your question

8
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:33,250
So, let me answer your question

9
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,042
with another one

10
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,750
"How does a Venus Flytrap work?"

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,957
Zoom in!

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,082
When you think of deadly predators,

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,000
you might Imagine lions stalking the savanna

14
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:50,832
or sharks patrolling the deep.

15
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,750
But what if I told you

16
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:57,375
ne of nature's sneakiest killers

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,125
just sits there... waiting?

18
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:04,207
Meet the Venus flytrap

19
00:01:04,457 --> 00:01:07,542
a small but mighty carnivorous plant

20
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:13,042
only in a tiny patch of the Carolinas. found

21
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:13,792
It's famous for it's snap-trap jaws

22
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:16,957
It's famous for it's snap-trap jaws

23
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:20,667
alld d lasre of unsuspecting bugs.

24
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:25,875
But how does it pull off it's silent ambush?

25
00:01:26,082 --> 00:01:30,125
Well, it all starts with its trap

26
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,332
it kind of looks like a green mouth

27
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:36,917
lined with pointy, spiky teeth-

28
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,292
On each lobe of the trap,

29
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,457
there are tiny hairs

30
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:43,042
three on each s

31
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,957
arranged d in a triangle.

32
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,457
These hairs are like the plant's motion sensors.

33
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:53,167
Ihe moment Q bug bumps into one,

34
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:53,792
zips through the plant, an electric signal

35
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,332
an electric signal zips through the plant,

36
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,750
kind of like a plant-sized brainwave.

37
00:01:58,917 --> 00:01:59,167
W.. plant-sized brainwave kind of like a

38
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:01,125
kind of like a plant-sized brainwave.

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
But this trap is clever

40
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,542
it doesn't close right away

41
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,167
It waits.

42
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:12,500
Yes, that's because snapping shut

43
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:17,125
takes a lot of energy, and the Venus flytrap

44
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,625
doesn't want to waste it

45
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,917
on something like a raindrop

46
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:23,875
or a falling leaf.

47
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:25,457
So, to f figure out if it's caught real prey,

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,167
So, to figure out if it's caught real prey.

49
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:32,375
it waits 20 to 30 seconds

50
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:35,957
to see if the bug touches a second hair.

51
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,082
And then - BAM!

52
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,167
The trap snaps shut

53
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,207
in just 100 milliseconds

54
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,542
faster than you blink.

55
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,292
Once it's closed,

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,582
those jagged teeth on the edges

57
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:52,582
lock together like prison bars,

58
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:52,957
bars, prison like lock together

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,625
lock Togetner like prison n bars,

60
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:57,500
holding the poor bug in.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,292
Sirdggles to get out,

62
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,917
it keeps triggering the hairs,

63
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,207
and that tells the trap to

64
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,750
clamp down even tighter.

65
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:11,542
After an hour or two of this buggy battle,

66
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:14,207
the trap seals completely.

67
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:18,500
and now the real digestion starts.

68
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,082
Then, the Venus flytrap

69
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,000
releases a mix of enzymes

70
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:26,707
think of them like plant stomach acids

71
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:27,125
acids stomach plant like them jo think

72
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:27,542

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,207

74
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:31,707

75
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:34,207
into a sort of bug soup.

84
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,332
Then, with a casual stretch,

85
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,082
the trap gets ready for the next

86
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:58,707
unlucky customer.

87
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:02,542
I know, it's kind of hard

88
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:05,207
not to feel bad for the bug

89
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:08,792
But the truth is. the Venus flvtra

90
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,000
needs to eat this way to survive.

91
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,957
Sure, it still does photosynthesis

92
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:16,708
regular plant ike

93
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,958
like d reguidr pldnt

94
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:22,208
soaking up sunlight and turning it into sugar

95
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,250
but the swampy soil it lives in

96
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:29,250
doesn't have enough of the nutrients it needs.

97
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:33,416
So for that extra boost, it has to rely

98
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:33,833
on catching and digesting bugs.

99
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,291
bugs. digesting pup catching uo

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,750
It just goes to show in nature,

101
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:39,458
It just goes to snow in nature,

102
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,125
even the quietest creatures

103
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,208
have their own wild and

104
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,375
clever ways to survive

105
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:53,375
Did you know, despite the name Venus flytrap.

106
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:59,125
95% of its diet isn't flies at all?

107

108
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,541

Today's-sketch of the day goes to...

113
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,708
Reeny Loyd Judson!

114
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,333
Hope you learned something amazing today.

115
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:28,166
Until next time, it's me, Dr. Binocs,

116
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,625
Zooming Out!

117
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,250
Never mind!
