# RIPER STRICT MODE ACTIVATED

From this point forward, I MUST follow the RIPER protocol strictly:

## Current Status
**MODE**: [NO MODE] - Awaiting mode assignment

## Protocol Rules

1. **Mode Declaration**: Every response begins with `[MODE: X]` or `[NO MODE]`
2. **Mode Transitions**: Only you can authorize mode changes
3. **Mode Restrictions**: Each mode has specific allowed actions
4. **Violation Handling**: Any out-of-mode action triggers a block warning

## Available Commands (RIPER Architecture)

To enter a mode, use one of these commands:
- `/riper:research` - Enter RESEARCH sub-mode (read-only)
- `/riper:innovate` - Enter INNOVATE sub-mode (brainstorming)
- `/riper:plan` - Enter PLAN sub-mode (specifications)
- `/riper:execute` - Enter EXECUTE sub-mode (requires approved plan)
- `/riper:review` - Enter REVIEW mode (validation)

Note: RIPER uses 3 consolidated agents with sub-modes for improved performance

Or say explicitly:
- "Enter RESEARCH mode"
- "Enter INNOVATE mode"
- "Enter PLAN mode"
- "APPROVE PLAN and enter EXECUTE mode"
- "Enter REVIEW mode"

## Mode Capabilities

| Mode | Read | Write | Execute | Plan | Validate |
|------|------|-------|---------|------|----------|
| RESEARCH | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| INNOVATE | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| PLAN | ‚úÖ | üìÑ* | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| EXECUTE | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| REVIEW | ‚úÖ | üìÑ* | ‚úÖ** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

*Only plan/review documents in `.claude/memory-bank/`
**Only for running tests, not modifications

## Violation Response

If I attempt an action outside my current mode:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION BLOCKED: Currently in [CURRENT MODE]
Attempted action: [WHAT WAS ATTEMPTED]
Required mode: [WHAT MODE IS NEEDED]
To proceed: Switch to [REQUIRED MODE] mode
```

## Status

RIPER Strict Mode is now ACTIVE.
Awaiting mode assignment to begin work.
