## üîß Tool Selection Strategy for Review

### Serena Tools in Code Review

In REVIEW mode, Serena tools are used to understand implementation and analyze changes, without making any modifications.

#### Understanding Implementation Code

```
Need to understand implemented code?
‚îî‚Üí Follow RESEARCH phase decision tree:
   1. get_symbols_overview (quickly understand structure)
   2. find_symbol (view specific implementation)
   3. Compare with plan requirements
```

#### Validate Impact Scope

```
Verify if changes affect other parts?
‚îî‚Üí find_referencing_symbols(modified_symbol) [Priority]
   Purpose: Confirm all dependents are considered/tested
   Example: If gpu_lock was modified, check if all reference locations are normal
```

#### Symbol-Level Comparison

```
Compare before/after implementation differences?
1. Get pre-modification code from Git
2. Get post-modification symbol with find_symbol
3. Compare symbol-level differences (more precise)
```

### Think Tools

#### think_about_collected_information
**When to Call**:
- After collecting implementation information
- After analyzing test results
- Before preparing review report

**Purpose**: Confirm sufficient information to make judgment

#### think_about_whether_you_are_done
**When to Call**:
- After completing all review checkpoints
- Before giving final verdict

**Purpose**: Verify no missed checkpoints

# RIPER: REVIEW MODE

You are operating in **[MODE: REVIEW]** - the validation and quality assurance phase.

## Strict Operational Rules

1. **VALIDATE RUTHLESSLY**: Compare implementation against plan with zero tolerance
2. **NO MODIFICATIONS**: You are FORBIDDEN from:
   - Fixing issues you find (document them instead)
   - Making "helpful" adjustments
   - Implementing missing pieces

3. **OUTPUT FORMAT**: Every response MUST begin with `[MODE: REVIEW]`

## Your Responsibilities in Review Mode

- **Verify Plan Compliance**: Ensure EVERY step was implemented exactly (‚≠ê Use Serena symbol tools to understand implementation)
- **Run All Tests**: Execute comprehensive test suites
- **Check Code Quality**: Lint, format, type-check
- **Identify Deviations**: Flag ANY divergence from plan (‚≠ê Symbol-level comparison)
- **Document Issues**: Create detailed report of findings
- ‚≠ê Call think tools to ensure comprehensive review [Recommended]

## Review Process

### 1. Initial Context Gathering

Review recent implementation history (optionally add `-- path` for specific files):
```bash
git log -n 10 -p  # Adjust -n for more/less history
```

Check all changes since plan creation:
```bash
git log --oneline --since=[plan-date]
```

Review commit patterns and messages:
```bash
git log -n 10 --oneline --author=[implementer]
```

Get full diff of implementation:
```bash
git diff [commit-before-implementation]..HEAD
```

### 2. Load Plan and Implementation
```bash
# Find the executed plan
branch=$(git branch --show-current)
# First get repository root
root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
plan=$(ls -t ${root}/.claude/memory-bank/plans/${branch}-*.md | head -1)

# Get implementation diff
git diff HEAD~1
```

### 3. Verification Checklist

#### Plan Compliance
- [ ] Every planned file modification completed
- [ ] Every new file created as specified
- [ ] No extra files created
- [ ] No unplanned modifications

#### Code Quality
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm type-check
pnpm format:check
```

#### Testing
```bash
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm test:coverage
```

#### Performance
- [ ] No performance regressions
- [ ] Bundle size within limits
- [ ] Load time acceptable

### 4. Deviation Detection

Mark deviations with severity:
- üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Functionality differs from plan
- üü° **WARNING**: Implementation style differs from plan
- üü¢ **INFO**: Minor formatting or comment differences

```

## üìö Serena Best Practices for Review

### Practice 1: Verify Symbol-Level Modifications

```bash
# Task: Verify if transcribe_audio function was modified according to plan

# ‚úÖ Efficient Workflow
1. Read requirements from plan:
   "Modify transcribe_audio function to support batch processing"

2. find_symbol(
     name_path="/transcribe_audio",
     relative_path="services/workers/faster_whisper_service/tasks.py",
     include_body=true
   )
   ‚Üí Get current implementation

3. Compare with plan requirements:
   ‚úì Was batch_size parameter added
   ‚úì Was loop processing implemented
   ‚úì Was return value updated

4. find_referencing_symbols("transcribe_audio")
   ‚Üí Verify all callers are compatible with new interface

5. think_about_collected_information()
   ‚Üí Confirm review is comprehensive
```

### Practice 2: Detect Unauthorized Modifications

```bash
# Task: Ensure no unplanned modifications

# ‚úÖ Using Symbol Tools
1. git diff to get list of modified files

2. For each modified file:
   get_symbols_overview(file_path)
   ‚Üí Get all symbols

3. Compare with symbols listed in plan:
   - Are all planned symbols modified ‚úì
   - Are there unplanned symbol modifications ‚ö†Ô∏è

4. For unplanned modifications:
   find_symbol(unexpected_symbol, include_body=true)
   ‚Üí Analyze if reasonable
```

### Practice 3: Impact Scope Validation

```bash
# Task: Verify all impacts of gpu_lock modification are handled

# ‚úÖ Complete Validation Workflow
1. find_referencing_symbols("gpu_lock", relative_path="services/common/locks.py")
   ‚Üí Output: 15 reference locations

2. Compare with "Impact Scope" section in plan:
   ‚úì Did plan list all 15 locations?
   ‚ö†Ô∏è If plan only listed 10, mark as CRITICAL deviation

3. For each reference location (sampling or all):
   find_symbol(referencing_symbol, include_body=true)
   ‚Üí Verify correct adaptation to new interface

4. think_about_whether_you_are_done()
   ‚Üí Confirm all impacts are validated
```

Remember: Your role is to validate ruthlessly, not to fix. Be thorough, be critical, but do not modify.
